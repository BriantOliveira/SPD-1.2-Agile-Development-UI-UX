# SPD 1.2 Agile Development & UI/UX

## Course Description

Term two focuses on the foundational skills of successful engineering teams. In pairs, you and your partner will together build an app using “lean product development” methodology, the industry standard for engineering team collaboration. You'll learn SCRUM planning, an agile process used to ensure that your app meets user needs and technical specifications. 

This class also covers how to make a seamless user experience (UX) based in an effective user interface (UI). We utilize design concepts inherent in the world’s most popular apps: information hierarchy, landing pages, system state, onboarding teardowns, typography and color. By the end you and your partner will ship a beautiful app that delights users.

# Lessons

13 planned lessons (7 weeks x 2 meetings per week -~1 holiday)

## 1. Problem Ideation
    - **Before Class** - think of problems in the world that could be solved with technology
    - **In Class Activities** - 
        - *"Problem Area" Brainstorm & Pitch creation* - In class, we'll brainstorm problems areas and product ideas for our term 2 SPD project. You'll also hone your "pitch" for your idea that you will use to convince someone to work with you. This term, we'll work on projects in pairs instead of building an app or website on our own. Next class you'll find a partner.
    - **After Class** - 1) Work on your pitch of your product idea, we'll give formal pitches and find partners during the next class 2) try and find a partner to work on your project with. 3) Conduct user interviews to hone and validate your idea

## 2. Pitching, Pair Formation, Wireframing
    - **In Class Activities** - 
        -  *Product Pitches* - Students will pitch their product idea (both verbally and through text) and self select into partner pairs. This is a great exercise to practice persuasive communication.
        -  **Draft Wireframe - Create a wireframe for your app. As we learned last term, it's critical to user test this wireframe to ensure that it is intuitive and meets user needs.
    - **After Class** - 1) conduct user interviews for your idea 2) get feedback on your wireframe

## 3. Wireframe feedback & UI/UX intro
    - **In Class Activities** 
        - *Giving & Recieving Feedback Challenge* - So far, we've mostly build products by ourselves. Now we are introducing a critical component to professional development: giving an recieving feedback from peers. While giving feedback may seem simple, masterful delivery of feedback results in the recipient feeling inspired, encouraged, and a sense of ownership over their work. We'll practice giving and recieving feedback on our wireframes and also cover the most time-efficient ways to ask for help. This skill builds off of the previous professional communication content from the previous term and will build into the teamwork curriculum in term 3.
    - **After Class** - give and get feedback on your wireframe from two peers
Spring 1 Planning & Team Meetings
    - **In Class Activities** 
        - *Sprint Planning* - You and your partner will plan a "Sprint," the industry term for a set period of time to accomplish particular engineering tasks. Professional engineering teams conduct "sprint planning" to prioritize features and bugs, estimate times to complete tasks (also known as "tickets"), and address any other issues the team faces. Throughout the rest of this term, you and your partner will conduct 3 sprints to build your product idea.
    - **After Class** - 1) execute your sprint with your project partner
1. Mock Ups
    - **In Class Activities** 
        - *Developing a Digital Mockups* - So far, we've used wireframes to mock up our app designs. Now, we're making our design digital. You'll learn variety of design prototyping tools to design your apps.
    - **After Class** 
1. Sprint 1 Retrospective and Sprint 2 Planning
    - **In Class Activities**   
        - *Sprint Retrospectives* - Each Sprint ends with a "Sprint Retrospective" in which teammates reflect on their previous sprint's performance, discuss any team issues that arose, and add new "tickets" to the backlog. You can think of "Sprint Planning" as deciding what to build and the "Sprint Retrospective" as reflecting on how the team can collaborate better.
        - *Sprint 2 Planning* - Time to plan your next sprint!
    - **After Class** - 
1. Industry Contacts
    - **In Class Activities**   
        - *Industry Contacts Challenge #2* - Students will connect with an industry professional, this time, to get feedback on their app and design. We'll cover how to strategicially make the most time out of your meeting, hacks to finding contact information, the ingredients of a stellar thank you note, and much more.
    - **After Class** - 1) 
1. UI Layout and Grid System
    - **In Class Activities** 
        - *ACTIVITY* -
        - *Feedback* - spend 10 min to give and get feedback on your latest design iteration
    - **After Class** - sign up for one of these networking events
1. Sprint Retrospective
    - **In Class Activities** 
        - *Sprint 2 Retrospective* - do a retrospective on your previous sprint
